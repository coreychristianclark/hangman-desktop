# Hangman (Desktop)

My first follow-along project with React and TypeScript.

A timeless, classic game of Hangman where you attempt to guess the word by guessing letters and building upon them.

My objective with this project was to learn more about React and TypeScript and build repetition into concepts.

It is my goal to revisit this and add some personal touches/customization once my experience increases.
